# # Second Brain

import { Emoji } from "./examples/Emoji/Emoji.tsx"


Hello everyone <Emoji name="waving-hand-152"/> And welcome to my second brain! (its online version at least) Some people may also call it a digital garden, but I prefer the former name. In short, this is the place where I:
 - Share my knowledge obtained through a variety of sources: from books to conversations
 - Write down my thoughts & ideas
 - Improving my writing skills
 - Collect inspiring and thouguful quotes [[Quotes]]
 - Store detailed summaries of books I read [[Books]]

At first, I write everything down in the offline version of my second brain, which is powered by (in my opinion) the best note-taking system called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). After that, I publish some of them right here using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and a theme called [gatsby-theme-kb](https://github.com/hikerpig/gatsby-project-kb). The theme was inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), so it is a perfect solution for me that I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a way to publish notes in markdown `.md` format with a fast search and a graph visualisation model. It even supports the comment system! How cool is that!? <Emoji name="grinning-face-with-big-eyes-2"/>

But wait.. probably I should have introduced myself first. <Emoji name="thinking-face-32"/>

## Кто такой (who is) Aleksandr Molchagin?

If you accessed this page directly through the address link, you probably don't know me. If you accessed this page through my [main website](https://aleksandrmolchagin.com), you probably still don't know me since I haven't published it yet and you couldn't access it!
