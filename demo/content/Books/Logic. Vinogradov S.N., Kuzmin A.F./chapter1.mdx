# I. The subject and objetives of the science of logic

## The logic of thinking and the science of logic

**The logic** is the science of the laws and forms of the correct construction of thoughts. It is what helps us to study how to be able to express ourselves correctly using *definite, non-contradictory, consistent and rational thinking.*

## Logical laws and forms

Correct thinking consists of four essential characteristics: 
- certainty
- the lack of contradictions
- consistency 
- validity

Violations of the laws of logic lead to a wrong conclusion.

Example of correct conclusion:

All the cities in the Arctic Circle have white nights. Igarka is located in the Article Circle. **Therefore, there are white nights in Igarka.**


Example of a logic violation:

All the cities in the Arctic Cicle have white nights. Leningrad (Saint Petersburg) is NOT located in the Article Circle. **Therefore, there are no white nights in Leningrad (Saint Petersburg).**  *This is wrong. Leningrad (Saint Petersburg) has white nights. The inaccurate conclusion was reached as a result of an incorrect logical form used while examining the first statement.*

Logic studies the forms of thinking. Laws of logic and its forms are common to all mankind, meaning that people of different eras and countries use the same logical laws. Otherwise, they would not be able to understand each other. The way of how humans think may change, but laws of that process will remain the same.
