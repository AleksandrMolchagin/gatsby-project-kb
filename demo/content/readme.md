# Gatsby knowledge base theme

This is a Gatsby theme for publishing knowledge base or personal wiki. Named `gatsby-theme-kb`.

Create your [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) by writing down your thoughts - or as the term used this theme `topics` -  and their relations in markdown.

Heavily inspired by [gatsby-digital-garden](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden) and [Obsidian](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Index).

## âœ¨ Features

- Support bidirectional wiki-links in double brackets `[[]]`.
- Hover preview for wiki-links.
- A nice interactive [[graph-view]] visualizing the relationships of your notes.
- Mobile friendly responsive design.
- Light and dark mode.
- Auto-generated table of contents.
- Configurable `mdx` processing system, with the power of `gatsby-plugin-mdx`.

## Working with knowledge management tools

### Foam
